# CollectiveCore - Book API

## Overview

**CollectiveCore** is a simple and clean ASP.NET Core Web API project designed to manage books and users. It demonstrates solid software design principles such as:

- Repository Pattern for data access abstraction  
- Async CRUD operations with Entity Framework Core  
- Nullable reference types and model validation  
- RESTful API endpoints for typical book/user management  

This project serves as a practical example of building maintainable, scalable backend services using modern .NET technologies.

## Features

- Manage Users/Books: Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations
- Proper use of async programming and dependency injection  
- Book verification system: only verified books are trusted, unverified can be edited by owner  (coming soon!)
- Flexible search capabilities for books based on criteria (coming soon!)

## Tech Stack

- **.NET Core**  
- **Entity Framework Core** (Code First Migrations)  
- **SQL Server / LocalDB** (configurable in `appsettings.json`)  
- **Git & GitHub** for version control and collaboration
