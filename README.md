# CollectiveCore - Book API

## Overview

**CollectiveCore** is a clean, focused ASP.NET Core Web API project for managing users and books. It demonstrates solid backend architecture with:

- Repository Pattern for abstracted data access
- Async CRUD operations using Entity Framework Core
- Nullable reference types and server-side model validation
- RESTful API endpoints for managing books and users

This project serves as a practical, real-world example of how to build scalable, maintainable backend services with modern .NET technologies.
