# CollectiveCore

## Overview

**CollectiveCore** is a full-stack application built with a .NET Core Web API backend and a modern React + TypeScript frontend. It provides 
a clean foundation for managing users and books, with a focus on simplicity, maintainability, and real-world development practices.

## Features

- Manage Users/Books: Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations
- User-specific (many to many) book relationships: mark books as favorites, track reading progress, etc.
- React frontend for browsing and managing book collections with clean API endpoint integration
- Book verification system: only verified books are trusted; unverified books remain editable by their creator (coming soon!)
- Flexible book search and filtering by genre, author, and more (coming soon!)
